If [[Sunna Guradan]] represents how the Ashlanders imagine their "heaven", then the fiery caverns of Molaguradan below [[Tel Vos]] is how they imagine their "hell".

> "In ancient times, Molaguradan was a burial place for several tribes which lived in the area, including the [[salkurnudai]]. In modern times, we entomb our dead by other means, but the fiery caverns of Molaguradan are still a sacred place. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the caverns now that the Telvanni lord built his tower atop it."
