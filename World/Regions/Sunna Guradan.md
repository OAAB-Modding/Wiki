> "The settled people call this place the Grazelands. This name is fitting as our herds feed off of the rich grass which grows in the dark soil here. However, to us, this land is much more significant than just fertile grasslands. These are the blessed lands of life and greenery. This is how we envision the afterlife appears to our ancestors. And as a Wise Woman, I have dreamt of the otherworld and can tell you that our ancestors believe much the same."

Sunna Guradan translates to "blessed green land" and is how the ashlanders refer to the grazelands -- at least when discussing it from a spiritual perspective. They think it represents how their afterlife looks. And this link to the dream world of their ancestors manifests sometimes in phenomenon such as the [[ghost-lantern]].
