> Wise Woman (dialogue): The lantern is a physical manifestation of the ancestor spirit's link to the otherworld. The dream world of the dead. While they possess it, they can roam [[Sunna Guradan]] -- or the Grazelands as the settled people call it -- freely. But if they lose it, they will be doomed to wander until they descend into madness and must be banished. ([[OAAB Grazelands]])
