Beasts who consume the flesh of man or mer are named "maneaters" and generally must be put down once they have a taste for it. Some cultures assign mystical powers to these beasts. <sup>[1]</sup>

> "Wild animals consuming people's spirits together with their flesh and gradually becoming something more than animal is a common motif in Ashlander folk tales... Mere superstitions of course, but the Waste Folk take it very seriously and immediately dispose of maneaters in their territory."
>
> "I never met Kintus Yanudadammu. But a few people have reported large creatures -- not just [[nix-hound]]s -- in the grazelands. It's a dangerous place. Don't be fooled by the idyllic appearance."
> -- [[Yakin Bael]] (dialogue) <sup>[1]</sup>

> "This beast has been here for some time. It intrudes on my dreams and visions and grows stronger with every spirit it consumes. Our hunters have not been able to find it. I believe it has become very cunning to evade capture. A dangerous beast indeed."
> -- Wise Woman (dialogue) <sup>[1]</sup>

> "I'm glad to hear that the nix-beast is dead. Nix-hounds are typically content to scavenge for scraps outside of camps and towns. But occasionally one is emboldened by the smell of vulnerable spirits and will attack. Consuming the body and spirit of the victim and becoming even more powerful and cunning. I am pleased that you managed to end this insatiable cycle."
> -- [[Maela Kaushad]] (dialogue) <sup>[1]</sup>
