### Modded
After Raven helps [[aryon|Aryon]] orchestrate the death of [[dratha|Dratha]] and [[endar-drenim|Endar Drenim]] assuming lordship of [[tel-mora|Tel Mora]], it is implied that Raven will become the new spymaster of House Telvanni.[^1]

[[galos-mathendis|Galos Mathendis]] implies that Raven has a dark personality.[^2]

> Hello again, %PCName. Come to ask questons about my research? At least you don't have to worry about mine involving unholy powers at every turn. Unlike with [[raven-omayn|Raven Omayn]] and Dratha. I used to hear Raven muttering things to herself, dark, brooding things. I don't miss her company.

* Apply Pressure to the Wound[^1]
