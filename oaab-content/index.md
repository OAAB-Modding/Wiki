**Welcome to the OAAB Wiki!** This site is intended to collect lore, world-building, and characterization from among various OAAB-compatible mods into a single location. This can be used as a reference to build on ideas or keep their mods consistent with others for a cohesive player experience.

So far, the wiki includes information from [[oaab-data|OAAB_Data]], [[oaab-grazelands|OAAB Grazelands]], [[oaab-tel-mora|OAAB Tel Mora]], and [[red-wisdom-an-ashlander-prophecy|Red Wisdom - An Ashlander Prophecy]]. We hope to expand it to include more mods soon!

If you would like to contribute, come join the [OAAB Discord](https://discord.gg/g5E2HUp) server.
