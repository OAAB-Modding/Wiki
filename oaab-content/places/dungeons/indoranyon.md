> The adventurer, after a few hours of instruction, paid the old teacher and set off on his way. [Indoranyon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Indoranyon "Morrowind:Indoranyon"), Egroamaro's stronghold, was not far from [Sadrith Mora](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sadrith_Mora "Morrowind:Sadrith Mora"), and he soon saw the blight and ruin that was the battlemage's calling card. Delving into the depths of the ruins, Silverthorn was set upon by the servitors of Egroamaro, living and undead. With his enchanted ebony blade, he cut through legions before facing the master himself in the desolate main hall.
