### Modded
As a coastal tribe, their treatment of the island of Ald Daedroth as a safe haven, and their wise woman walking on water, the association between the Ahemmusa and water is relatively easy. Water is related to Oblivion (Waters of Oblivion) and also with memory. The Ahemmusa long for a time past before the corprus men stalked them in the storms and the settled people encroached upon their lands. They also live in close proximity to a Daedric shrine and move to one as part of their quest -- since it is an ancient, safe haven for them -- which demonstrates their affinity for the Daedra as well. The coastal Ahemmusa tribe has a secluded grotto which serves as their burial cavern. The grotto opens into a wide chamber where the Ahemmusa have created bug shell rafts to carry their dead. The salt water used in their mummification rituals and rich salt air both serve to dry out the mummies and keep them preserved. It is rumored that every Ahemmusa possesses the ability to walk on water. Whether this is true or not, it isn't known whether this is hereditary or part of their magic-imbued tribal rituals. The tribe has been known to move from island to island, treating the inland sea as if it was their own "ashlands". Just as the sea is a fickle mistress, the Ahemmusa are flighty and prone to abrupt changes in plans as new information arises.
