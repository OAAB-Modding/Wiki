The Spine of [Ashpit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ashpit) is like a space elevator through the center of Ashpit which extends down to Nirn where it is said to manifest as a “Door to Oblivion” within dust and fire devils. It is said that the space elevator even extends to Aetherius - but the way has been long lost to mortal knowledge.

Denizens of Ashpit - such as the Malacath’s Warlocks, the Malakh-Orcs - ride clouds through the realm among the various celestial spheres which each house a unique breed of goblinkin or orc-kin.

The realm is inhabited by sentient thunder which live in storm voidstreams.
