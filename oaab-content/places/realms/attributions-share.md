Small creatures of all teeth run among the shrubbery of [Boethiah’s realm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Attribution%27s_Share). Biting off the ring fingers of unwary visiting politicians to take back to their master who uses them for leverage to extort future favors to delight the Prince of Plots. Because “Talos forbid” the other council members know that Councilor Baro was using the Queen of Shadow’s private conspiratory pocket chambers to hatch a coup d’etat against the Crown.

Boethiah has also been known to employ cursed rings which cannot be removed after being placed upon a mortal finger to mark those who have dealt with the Prince.
