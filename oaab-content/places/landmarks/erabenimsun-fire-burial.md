### Modded
Erabenimsun are associated with fire since they live in the [[molag-amur|Molag Amur]] region and some of their older members are known to have personalities of a fiery nature. It is rumored that their burial caverns are filled with lava pits and magma flows. They place their recently deceased into “heat tubes” to quickly dry out the cadavers. This process imbues the Erabenimsun mummies with a dark, cracked surface and white ash which blasts them from the earth's heat covers the front of the mummies, giving them a ghostly appearance. Sometimes their warriors will also dawn white ash death masks of their own when going into battle. Particularly when they have the expectation that they will die.
