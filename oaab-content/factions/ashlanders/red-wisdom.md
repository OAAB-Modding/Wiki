An individual foretold to save the Dunmer people by an ancient [[hassours-red-wisdom|Ashlander prophecy]] from a future calamity.

> There shall come a time when the false gods shall slip away, as they have been, and there will be terrible plagues and disasters afflicting us. If the tribes would survive, we must find and follow Red Wisdom. In these last months, I have dreamed of Red Wisdom. I have seen her face. I know her time has come. I have sent my apprentice to the Erabenimsun fire burial to look for signs of Red Wisdom. If you would learn more, find her there.
