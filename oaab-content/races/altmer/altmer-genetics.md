Altmer practice genetic engineering, biomodification, and selective breeding. They are skilled creators of homunculi which are typically created from parts of various creatures combined together and then bound with a Daedric soul. This has created things such as the Chimera of Summerset which are feared throughout Tamriel.

Lesser homunculi are popular in the Mages Guild as pets and familiars. They generally combine two different creatures.

Goblins are a devolution of Altmer. Altmer have unstable gene stock which is deteriorating post-Convention much more quickly than other races (Ehlnofey->Aldmer->Altmer->Goblins). Due to this, the Altmer have a tight birth control regime, selective breeding amongst themselves, and practice longevity techniques to decrease the number of generations over the passing years and slow this progression. Crystal-Like-Law imposed its stasis on the Altmer to further slow this process. Most goblin-babies are aborted and disposed of, but those which manage to be saved or escape take refuge in the isles around Summerset and are often used for manual labor by the Altmer who refuse to acknowledge the goblin lineage in public.
