Solstheim is a large island northwest of Vvardenfell with a cold climate, hostile to most plant life. The plants in this area are hardy, thriving in Solstheim's snowy mountainous regions and lush evergreen forests. If one is willing to brave the dangers and harsh climes of this land, it is worth taking note of the following plants useful to alchemists.
### Belladonna
Belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade, is a small perennial shrub that bears small round fruit. Green in their unripened state, they eventually turn a deep black. This fruit is surrounded by broad, pointed petals of a dusky violet coloration. The leaf is broad, oily, and flat, and can cause a severe rash if bare skin comes in contact with it. This plant sometimes appears brown and withered when covered by the year's frosts, but don't let that fool you. This plant is a survivor, and can remain dormant for many years. It does however have a low tolerance for sunlight, and does not cultivate well. It can grow almost anywhere in the wild, provided there is enough shade. The fruit can be picked in either its ripened or unripened state, and carries the same alchemical properties.
### Holly  
The holly bush sports sharp, pleated, evergreen leaves of a shiny dark green coloration, and grows bright red berries. It is most often found in the forested areas of Solstheim, but can also be spotted along snowy plains. The berries tend to bloom in the late autumn and early winter, and are hard and inedible. These berries eventually soften over the winter through repeated frosting and thawing. Holly has spritual significance to the native Skaal, and is often used by shaman to treat frostbite. Holly berries have alchemical properties related to their environment. In other words, they are useful for frost resistances and related effects.
