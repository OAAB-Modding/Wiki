The Collected Love Poems by the Breton Bard Deandre  
***

### In Her Embrace  
Flaxen hair  
Tossed over bare shoulders  
Supple ivory skin  
Exposed in my naked eye  
  
How I long to  
Touch every inch  
Feel every curve  
Taste every drop  
To hear every sigh  
Sung through the choir  
  
To see every breath  
Smell every scent  
Become every thought  
I am undone  
  
Stripped of eloquence  
Lying in your embrace  
No longer myself  
Now a part of you  
I am more. 

***

### Lush Expanse  
Laid before me,  
A lush expanse  
Quivering under my gaze.  
My senses capture every essence,  
As I rise before you.  
My hands glide over silken dominion  
As your body rises in kind.  
Joined together,  
Time losing all meaning,  
Souls intertwined.  
I roam across your landscape,  
Ascending every mountain,  
Crossing every valley,  
Leaving no field unturned,  
As I find my way to you.  

***

### An Exquisite Song  
Come to me, my love.  
Lie in my arms,  
An exquisite song.  
I'll caress your neck,  
Pluck your strings gently,  
Filling the air  
With your beautiful music.  
I'll hold you close  
And play you through the night.  
Never stopping  
Until I am undone.  

***

### Dream a Dream  
Dream a dream, my sweet.  
Floating upon the currents of my love.  
Borne away by my tide.  
  
Come to me, my love.  
My soul your beacon.  
My breath your wind.  
  
Lay with me, my dear.  
My body your bed.  
My heart your blanket.  
  
Never leave me, my love.  
My caress your substance.  
My love your raiment.  

***

### Beautiful Flower  
My beautiful flower,  
Laying before me.  
Glistening with the morning dew,  
Petals eager to open.  
I caress your folds,  
Coaxing you to untwine.  
Opening up to me,  
I taste of your sweet nectar.  
Food of the Gods  
My only sustenance.  
Blossom beneath me  
As we greet the rising sun.  

***

### Beneath the Stars  
Lying 'neath the stars,  
Supple skin caressed by moonlight.  
Beside you, hands lazily tracing patterns,  
Feeling your heart rise.  
I move to you,  
Obeying your desire's every command.  
Your music fills my ears  
As our bodies move in time.  
With each breath,  
You draw me deeper into you.  
Skin ripples with pleasure,  
Washing over me.  
My waves crash against your shore.  
Receding, I crumple, spent  
As the moon retires to her bed.  
The sun peeks through the leaves,  
Covering us with its soft light.  

***

### Come to me  
Come to me, my love.  
Lay amongst my sheets,  
Reveal yourself to me.  
  
Breathe me in my love.  
Caress every curve,  
Fingertips painting my desire.  
  
Be mine always, my love.  
Hearts knowing no other,  
Bodies flowing in time.  

***

### Desire
Desire burning bright,  
Consumed by your fire.  
Yearning rising molten within me,  
Mingling with the passion of your flames,  
All reason burned away.  
Senses roaring, twisting to and fro.  
All thought extinguished,  
Devoured by you.  

***

### Whispers
Whisper on the wind,  
Cry escaping lips,  
Reaching across the plains,  
A spirit's call to be free.  
  
Ears strain with every heartbeat,  
Pierced by the sound.  
Body rises erect,  
Responding in kind.  
  
Striking forward,  
Challenging the wind.  
Course set as stone,  
Arrow unerring in flight.  
  
Desert burning below,  
Obstacles ignored.  
Beckoning,  
Seeking solace in union.
