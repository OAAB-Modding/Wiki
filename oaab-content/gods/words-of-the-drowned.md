This exact note is found in more than one location. It is a prescribed epitaph inspired by an unknown mystical entity. Some may know it as the god of the sea. Or is it a dreamsleeve demon? When a soul is doomed to die by drowning at sea, the inspiration may come upon them from the communal consciousness to write down these exact words. Repeating a pattern imprinted in the memory of the dreamsleeve. Water is memory.
