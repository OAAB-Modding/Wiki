Ebonarm hasn’t shown up past Daggerfall (and is most likely retconned along with the other gods there), but he’s usually described as a nutjob war god whose full name is Reymon Ebonarm. Reman conquered most of Tamriel, and given the whole idea that cultural belief influences different versions of gods, Reman and Ebonarm are the same individual. While the Imperials worship Reman as the Worldly God, the nations he conquered like High Rock and Hammerfell see him as an unstoppable god of war: Ebonarm.
