> The **pomegranate** is a succulent shrub that produces fruit with a sweet and tart flavored juice that is popularly fermented into wine. Pomegranates primarily grow in the Molag Amur region but have grown scarce due to the spread of the Blight. The few surviving fruit-bearing plants have developed a resistance to blight disease.
