### Modded
Geas is singular. Geasa is plural. These specialized curses are most frequently used by mabrigash.[^1]

> The Ashlanders call a Mabrigash's curse a "geas". Dratha has woven an immensely complex geas around herself which will be released in the event of her passing. The only contemporary magic users trained to defend against geasa are Wise Women. Whoever kills Dratha will need some sort of protection. This is a serious and dangerous undertaking, %PCName. Do you accept?

> A geas is not simply a "curse". It is a prohibition placed upon someone. If the geas is violated, the victim will suffer the consequences. But if they observe their geas, they will enjoy the blessings. Mabrigash will frequently place a geas on their male victims to control them -- and reward good behavior. Your description of this geas brings back an old memory... I must commune with my ancestors if you wish to learn more. Come back in a day.
