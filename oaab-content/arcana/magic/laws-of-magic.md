### Modded
**Law of Similarity** - states that "like produces like" or "an effect resembles its cause." This principle is based on the idea that a symbolic representation can influence the real entity it represents. -- extrapolated from [[milyn-faram|Milyn Faram]]'s (dialogue)

**Law of Intensification** - Illusion magic is amplified when multiple senses are triggered at once[^1]

**Law of Assimilation** - magic will cascade into every part of a target's body with the requisite environmental parameters[^1]
