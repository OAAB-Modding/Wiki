**Milyn Faram** is a [Telvanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:House_Telvanni "Morrowind:House Telvanni") [sorcerer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sorcerer "Morrowind:Sorcerer") of some renown, whose residence at the tower of [Odirniran](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Odirniran_(place) "Morrowind:Odirniran (place)") is under siege by a group of [Hlaalu](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:House_Hlaalu "Morrowind:House Hlaalu"). He has taken [Vedelea Othril](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vedelea_Othril "Morrowind:Vedelea Othril") prisoner for "experiments", and her sisters [Farare](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Farare_Othril "Morrowind:Farare Othril") and [Remasa](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Remasa_Othril "Morrowind:Remasa Othril") brought a rescue party to try and save her. Depending on which House you have joined, you will either [help them](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Telvanni_at_Odirniran "Morrowind:Telvanni at Odirniran") or [stop them](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Odirniran_(quest) "Morrowind:Odirniran (quest)").

Milyn Faram's research has resulted in [magical scrolls](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Milyn_Faram%27s_Scroll "Morrowind:Milyn Faram's Scroll") which can be used to summon [Daedroth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Daedroth "Morrowind:Daedroth"). If you rescue him from the Hlaalu and keep Vedelea unharmed, he will give you 7 of these. They can also be found in many other places as random loot. One guaranteed copy can be found on a table in [Assu](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Assu "Morrowind:Assu").

> Milyn Faram (dialogue): Scrolls of summoning are, without exception, based on the Law of Similarity as you must know. While others use parts of the creature, such as [Daedra skin](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Daedra_Skin "Morrowind:Daedra Skin") for summoning [Daedra](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Daedra "Morrowind:Daedra"), I have developed a new methods, based on a recovered [Dwemer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dwemer "Morrowind:Dwemer") machine. My scrolls only have an image of the Daedra, which works almost as well as a Daedra skin or [heart](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Daedra%27s_Heart "Morrowind:Daedra's Heart")... And at a fraction of the cost."
