### [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dratha)
**Dratha** is a [Dark Elf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dark_Elf "Morrowind:Dark Elf") [sorceress](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sorcerer) in the Upper Tower of [Tel Mora](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Tel_Mora "Morrowind:Tel Mora"). She is a Master in [House Telvanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:House_Telvanni "Morrowind:House Telvanni"). Mistress Dratha is extremely disdainful of men, such that she has banned men from living in her city. If you are female, you will experience many advantages in conversation with her. She is the oldest living Councilor in House Telvanni, sustained by the necromantic arts; [Divayth Fyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Divayth_Fyr "Morrowind:Divayth Fyr") is the only Telvanni older. Dratha is, like the other Councilors, an arrogant isolationist concerned with little more than maintaining power and collecting artifacts. She is rumored to have been pressured by the [Temple](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Tribunal_Temple "Morrowind:Tribunal Temple") to allow them to put some healers in Tel Mora (women, of course).

Dratha wears an [extravagant shirt](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Extravagant_Shirt "Morrowind:Extravagant Shirt") and an [exquisite skirt](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Exquisite_Skirt "Morrowind:Exquisite Skirt") with matching [shoes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Exquisite_Shoes "Morrowind:Exquisite Shoes"). She also carries a [glass stormblade](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Glass_Stormblade "Morrowind:Glass Stormblade"), a [scroll of the black storm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Scroll_of_The_Black_Storm "Morrowind:Scroll of The Black Storm"), a [scroll of manarape](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Scroll_of_Manarape "Morrowind:Scroll of Manarape"), and two [standard restore health potions](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Standard_Restore_Health_Potion "Morrowind:Standard Restore Health Potion"). Aside from her natural [resistance to fire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Fire "Morrowind:Resist Fire") and the [sanctuary](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ancestor_Guardian_(power) "Morrowind:Ancestor Guardian (power)") provided by her ancestors, she also knows [Dratha's Spite](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dratha%27s_Spite "Morrowind:Dratha's Spite").
