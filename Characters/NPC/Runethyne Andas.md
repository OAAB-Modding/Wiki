Is in love with someone based on a crumpled love note in the Vos Mill.

> Runethyne Andas (Note): I have no excuse to offer for my presumption in addressing this letter to one so greatly my superior, except my ardent love and admiration which burns hotly as the fires of Red Mountain. I hope which will be sufficient to plead my pardon and to procure me your pity. I have long tenderly loved you, but, till this moment, could never resolve to make a disclosure of my passion, on account of the inequality of our situations. I being only a humble miller. Say then, will you permit me to make you an offer of my heart? Will you suffer me to indulge the pleasing expectation of receiving from you a return of mutual love? I can only add, that I am duly sensible of my temerity, but should you condescend to accept my proposal, and by uniting your destiny with mine, make me the happiest of women, then shall my life be devoted to the constant promotion of your happiness. I am ever yours. ([[OAAB Grazelands]])
