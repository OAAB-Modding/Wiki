### [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Aryon)
**Aryon** is a [Dark Elf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dark_Elf "Morrowind:Dark Elf") [sorcerer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sorcerer "Morrowind:Sorcerer") living in [Tel Vos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Tel_Vos "Morrowind:Tel Vos"). He is a Master in [House Telvanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:House_Telvanni "Morrowind:House Telvanni") and appears to be the most fair and open-minded Councilor of the house. This is evident when looking at his tower which is something of an oddity even for a Telvanni: a Telvanni mushroom tower integrated into an [Imperial](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Imperial "Morrowind:Imperial") castle. Somewhat isolated on a council of anti-Imperial isolationists and eccentrics, he is desperately looking [for new allies](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Message_from_Master_Aryon "Morrowind:Message from Master Aryon"), be it his old mentor, [Divayth Fyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Divayth_Fyr "Morrowind:Divayth Fyr"), or [Baladas Demnevanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Baladas_Demnevanni_(person) "Morrowind:Baladas Demnevanni (person)"). [Smokey Morth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Smokey_Morth "Morrowind:Smokey Morth") has been saying - entirely correctly - he is doing so with the ultimate aim of usurping the [Archmagister](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Gothren "Morrowind:Gothren"). However, once you yourself become powerful enough in House Telvanni, he will instead support your bid to replace the incumbent Archmagister. He is also rumored to have enchanted [a pair](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Aryon%27s_Dominator "Morrowind:Aryon's Dominator") [of gloves](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Aryon%27s_Helper "Morrowind:Aryon's Helper") in his youth with powerful conjuration spells.

During the [Telvanni Hortator](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Telvanni_Hortator "Morrowind:Telvanni Hortator") part of the [Main Quest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Main_Quest "Morrowind:Main Quest"), Aryon understands the whole situation and immediately gives his vote for you to become Hortator of House Telvanni. He also offers advice on how to deal with the other Councilors. This is an example of his differences with the rest of House Telvanni, who are mainly concerned with slavery, artifacts, and their magickal studies.
