After he retires, Galos moves to Tel Vos where continues his research which is primarily focused on advanced enchanting techniques. <sup>[1]</sup>

Specifically, Galos is studying the function of enchanted doors. He sends an encoded message to [[Aryon]] which reveals this if it is translated:

> TO [[MILYN FARAM]]
> YOUR LATEST DISCOVERY IS INCREDIBLE
> IF YOU CAN PART WITH A SAMPLE I WOULD BE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL
> I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE KEY I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR TO UNLOCK THE GREATER POTENTIAL OF ENCHANTED DOORS
> YOU KNOW I HAVE STUDIED THOSE IN THE TELVANNI VAULT AND IN ARYONS OWN TOWER BUT THERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE I HOPE TO STUDY SOON
> AT THE RUINS OF INDORANYON
> YES EGROAMAROS LAIR
> I BELIEVE THAT HIS STUDENT QORWYNN MAY HAVE ADVANCED BEYOND HIS MASTERS SKILLS BY SOLICITING THE POWER OF A DAEDRA
> THOUGH I KNOW NOT WHOM
> YOUR RESPECTFUL COLLEAGUE
