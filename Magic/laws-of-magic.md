### Modded
**Law of Similarity** - states that "like produces like" or "an effect resembles its cause." This principle is based on the idea that a symbolic representation can influence the real entity it represents. -- extrapolated from [[Milyn Faram]]'s (dialogue)

**Law of Intensification** - Illusion magic is amplified when multiple senses are triggered at once <sup>[1]</sup>

**Law of Assimilation** - magic will cascade into every part of a target's body with the requisite environmental parameters <sup>[1]</sup>
