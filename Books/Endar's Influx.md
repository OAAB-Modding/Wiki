Theory of Influx
by Endar Drenim

I. Background
Influx is a powerful Illusion magic effect which overloads the victim's senses with a flood of sensory information, resulting in their entire body entering a paralysis-like stasis. This spell is unique in that it utilizes several laws of magic such as the Law of Intensification, which states that Illusion magic is amplified when multiple senses are triggered at once; and the Law of Assimilation, which states that magic will cascade into every part of a target's body with the requisite environmental parameters.
II. Preparation

In order to successfully cast the spell, the caster must first take the environment into account. The major part of an Illusion spell's powrr does not come from the caster themselves but by utilizing the sensory information derived from the environment the target inhabits. Like tipping a bookshelf onto a rat. This is done by focusing one's magical energy onto each sense of the target and using the Laws of Intensification and Assimilation to begin the influx.

III. Effects

When the spell is completed, the victim's body will enter a state of stasis. The victim's senses will be inundated with a flood of information, which will overwhelm them and cause them to become unable to move or react. Or even be affected by the passage of time itself. Just as the gods were frozen into bone beneath our feet. And exist outside the confines of time, so to will the victim become godlike. In this respect at least. This effect will last until the caster stops casting the spell or until the victim's senses are able to process the information.
