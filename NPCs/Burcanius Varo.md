### Quests
* Rats in Varo Tradehouse <sup>[1]</sup>
	* Burcanius asks the player to take a contract to the [[tel-vos|Tel Vos]] jail and purchase the freedom of [[Dro'zharim]] on his behalf so that he can serve as a rat catcher in his tradehouse which has been afflicted with rats since he ordered cheese from Cyrodiil. If the player chooses to give [[Dro'zharim]] to Burcanius, then the latter will offer the player a lifetime supply of scuttle.
