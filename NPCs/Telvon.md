### [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Note_to_Telvon)
Telvon does not exist in the original game (except for a seemingly unassociated smith). He is only mentioned in a note which can be found on the door of [Indoranyon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Indoranyon "Morrowind:Indoranyon").

> Telvon,  
> Stay out. This [place](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Indoranyon "Morrowind:Indoranyon") has some sort of enchantment on it. I only got out because I cast a [mark](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Mark "Morrowind:Mark") spell here before I went inside. Meet me back in [Vos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vos "Morrowind:Vos"). We'll have to seek our fortune elsewhere.
### Modded
Telvon is said to have disappeared after trying to enter Indoranyon. <sup>[1]</sup>

>  "I knew you must have found my note to Telvon. I have no idea where he is. He was a bull-headed man and I fear that he may have entered the ruins of Indoranyon despite my warning."
