### [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Menus_Felas)
**Menus Felas** is a [Dark Elf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dark_Elf "Morrowind:Dark Elf") [farmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Farmer "Morrowind:Farmer") who resides in his farmhouse in [[Vos]]. He appears to have recently moved to the town as evidenced by a [note](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Note_to_Menus "Morrowind:Note to Menus") and a bowl of kwama eggs found in his home that was given to him by [Ienasa Radas](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ienasa_Radas "Morrowind:Ienasa Radas") as a housewarming gift. Another [note](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Note_from_Berwen "Morrowind:Note from Berwen") in his house reveals that he recently purchased a bed from [Berwen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Berwen "Morrowind:Berwen") which he probably hopes to soon replace the simple bedroll in his home with.
