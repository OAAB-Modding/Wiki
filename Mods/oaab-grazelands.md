[OAAB Grazlands](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49075)

> This mod is an overhaul of Vos and Tel Vos, the land surrounding them, the two nearby egg mines, covering a large portion of the northern [[grazelands|Grazelands]]. Currently, the mod does not cover the entire [[grazelands|Grazelands]] region, but additional work is planned in future updates. The mod includes 16+ new quests with approximately 18,000 words of dialogue.
