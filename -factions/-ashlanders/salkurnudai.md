> "I have never heard that name uttered in the waking world, %PCName. Yes, I know it. The Salkurnudai were an ancient tribe who lived in these lands before the sea divided us. Where did you hear it?"
> 
> "In ancient times, [[molaguradan]] was a burial place for several tribes which lived in the area, including the Salkurnudai. In modern times, we entomb our dead by other means, but the fiery caverns of Molaguradan are still a sacred place. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the caverns now that the Telvanni lord built his tower atop it."
