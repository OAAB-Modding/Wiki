### Modded
The Willow Flower's large pink bloom is unmistakable. The name derives from the First Empire period Old Dunmereth "Wylloe", or "`[Departed's]` Will-Guide", a word perhaps signifying its role in ancient Nord burial rituals. Flower is five-part and fades to a lighter pink towards the center. The pale anthers are prominently displayed at the center of the broad petals. Stem is woody and branching. Leaves alternate. Knee to shoulder-high. Found near rocks, lightly wooded areas, partial shade. Ascadian Isles, Azura's Coast, Sheogorad. Willow anther is a common alchemical compound used in curative potions. <sup>[1]</sup>
