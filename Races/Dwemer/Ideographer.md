> [[Aryon]] (Note): Although it's original purpose is a mystery to me, I have found that the dwemer ideographer can be used to create summoning scrolls through a relatively cost effective process. ([[OAAB Grazelands]])

> [[Milyn Faram]] (dialogue): You may ask why would I not just scrawl out images of daedra onto parchment rather than using that bulky machine? Well, the reasons boil down to quality, %PCName. In order for the summoning to work, the image has to be an incredibly accurate representation of the target. That's why most enchanters use actual pieces of the daedra to establish this link.
