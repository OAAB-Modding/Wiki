> Monarchs are atronachs which are much more powerful than their kin. I won't bore you with the details of why some daedra are more potent than others -- suffice to say atronach monarchs are extremely rare. Flame Monarchs in particular are known to be incurably vainglorious. Reveling in the acclaim of mortals who are terrified by their fearsome appearance. Do not cower before the flame monarch or you will only embolden it.
