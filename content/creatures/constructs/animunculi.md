“Animunculi” from “anima” means “small souls”. Centurions have a sort of electron cloud made of soul fragments orbiting them instead of regular souls. The creation of animunculi might be connected to the [[races/dwemer/index|Dwemer]] aspirations to ascend; shattering souls down to the lowest sub-gradient.
