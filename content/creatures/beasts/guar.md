> On the outside, and in most respects, the guar of Morrowind resemble large, bipedal reptiles which can be found in other regions of Tamriel. So it is a common source of confusion to Imperial citizens visiting the province of Morrowind when they hear about “guar milk”. No, guar do not suckle their young in the manner of heartland sheep. Guar saliva is a thick mucus which they orally feed to their hatched young in a way resembling the behavior of some birds. The distinction is that although guar are ruminants, they do not feed their young with the cud. What may be alarming to outlanders, is that when a Dark Elf refers to “milk”, they’re actually discussing guar mucus which is a staple of the Dunmer diet. Just in the way that cheese is replaced with beetle cuttle and jelly with netch flesh, the Dark Elves never cease to amaze with their creative food replacements.
