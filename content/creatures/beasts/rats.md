Dunmer may train large rats to kill other rats in place of owning cats.

You don't see many dogs here in Morrowind -- or cats for that matter. Apparently the Dark Elves actually domesticated some larger breeds of rats and trained them as ratters. Fascinating, isn't that? But I have another idea. Maybe something you can help me with.
