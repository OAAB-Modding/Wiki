### Modded
Magically enchanted doors are occasionally employed by mages to move those opening them somewhere unexpected. Examples include the Telvanni Vaults in Vivec and the ruins of Indoranyon. This is the primary focus of [[galos-mathendis|Galos Mathendis]]' research.

> Ordinary keys unlock ordinary doors, correct? Yes, well some doors are not ordinary. So they require extraordinary keys with particular imbuements. The enchantment isn't important, but words of power are. It's all theoretical at this point and I know this might not make much sense. There are still some pieces of the puzzle that are missing.
