If you advance far enough in House Telvanni, he will eventually step down and return to his research.
### Modded
After he retires, Galos moves to [[tel-vos|Tel Vos]] where he continues his research which is primarily focused on advanced enchanting techniques.[^2]

Specifically, Galos is studying the function of [[magic-doors|enchanted doors]]. The [[message-from-galos-mathendis|Message from Galos Mathendis]] contains an encoded message to [[milyn-faram|Milyn Faram]] which reveals this if it is translated.[^2]
