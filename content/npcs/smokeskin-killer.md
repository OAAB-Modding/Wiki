### Modded
Named for killing Dunmer or "smoke skins", Smokeskin-Killer is a veteran of the Arnesian War. He is now employed by [[aryon|Aryon]] as the guard of his Dwemer Museum in [[tel-vos|Tel Vos]]. <sup>[1]</sup>

> He is the guard and caretaker of my Dwemer Museum. He's a good friend, but certainly not a scholar.
> -- [[aryon|Aryon]] (dialogue) <sup>[1]</sup>

> That's wonderful news! Smokeskin-Killer has been getting increasingly irritable without his potions. Don't tell him I told you this, but he's a veteran of the Arnesian War and the horrors of his experience still haunt him. The potions help him fight back the nightmares... Oh! I almost forgot the egg mines. So the two closest are Mudan-Mul and Sinarralit.
