> He is the guard and caretaker of my Dwemer Museum. He's a good friend, but certainly not a scholar.

> That's wonderful news! Smokeskin-Killer has been getting increasingly irritable without his potions. Don't tell him I told you this, but he's a veteran of the Arnesian War and the horrors of his experience still haunt him. The potions help him fight back the nightmares... Oh! I almost forgot the egg mines. So the two closest are Mudan-Mul and Sinarralit.
