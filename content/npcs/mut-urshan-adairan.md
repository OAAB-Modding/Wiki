### Modded
Mut is in a small camp near the [[zainab-sky-burial|Zainab Sky Burial]] along with [[addarnat-assardidairan|Addarnat Assardidairan]] and [[manu-odirnapal|Manu Odirnapal]]. They are all hostile by default. But if the player brings racer plumes to honor the ceremony occurring at the nearby [[zainab-sky-burial|Zainab Sky Burial]], Mut will become friendly.
### Quests
