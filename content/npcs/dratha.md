### [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dratha)
**Dratha**Â is aÂ [Dark Elf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dark_Elf "Morrowind:Dark Elf")Â [sorceress](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sorcerer)Â in the Upper Tower ofÂ [Tel Mora](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Tel_Mora "Morrowind:Tel Mora"). She is a Master inÂ [House Telvanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:House_Telvanni "Morrowind:House Telvanni"). Mistress Dratha is extremely disdainful of men, such that she has banned men from living in her city. If you are female, you will experience many advantages in conversation with her. She is the oldest living Councilor in House Telvanni, sustained by the necromantic arts;Â [Divayth Fyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Divayth_Fyr "Morrowind:Divayth Fyr")Â is the only Telvanni older. Dratha is, like the other Councilors, an arrogant isolationist concerned with little more than maintaining power and collecting artifacts. She is rumored to have been pressured by theÂ [Temple](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Tribunal_Temple "Morrowind:Tribunal Temple")Â to allow them to put some healers in Tel Mora (women, of course).
