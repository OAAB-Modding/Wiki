### Modded
Addarnat is in a small camp near the [[zainab-sky-burial|Zainab Sky Burial]] along with [[manu-odirnapal|Manu Odirnapal]] and [[mut-urshan-adairan|Mut Urshan-Adairan]]. They are all hostile by default. But if the player brings racer plumes to honor the ceremony occurring at the nearby [[zainab-sky-burial|Zainab Sky Burial]], Addarnat will become friendly.
### Quests
* The Search for Red Wisdom[^1]
	* Addarnat will attack the player if they do not bring the appropriate offerings to the sky burial.
