### [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Note_to_Telvon)
Telvon does not exist in the original game (except for a seemingly unassociated smith). He is only mentioned in a note which can be found on the door of [[indoranyon|Indoranyon]].

> [!Note]
> Telvon,  
> Stay out. This [place](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Indoranyon "Morrowind:Indoranyon") has some sort of enchantment on it. I only got out because I cast a [mark](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Mark "Morrowind:Mark") spell here before I went inside. Meet me back in [Vos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vos "Morrowind:Vos"). We'll have to seek our fortune elsewhere.

### Modded
Telvon is said to have disappeared after trying to enter [[indoranyon|Indoranyon]].[^1]
