Dro'zharim was a slave who was part of the original crew who built [[tel-vos|Tel Vos]] giving him intimate knowledge of some of the secret passages in the tower. After Dro'zharim is freed, the player can learn that he helped build [[tel-vos|Tel Vos]].[^1]

> Dro'zharim helped build tower. Knows of many, many secrets. Unfinished tower towards setting sun has metal ring to pull. Leads to secret place. There are more secret places. Look for walls which are not walls and floors which are not floors. What a strange place. Dro'zharim will not miss it.
