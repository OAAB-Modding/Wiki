### Modded

> "You met an ancestor, %PCName. A sacred and serious demonstration of favor. That lantern you found, we call it a ghost lantern. On occasion, our ancestors will walk the blessed lands of [[grazelands|Sunna Guradan]] in flesh by their own volition. This land is pleasant for them and free of any mortal chill which they shun. Sometimes they long for the warm breeze of Red Mountain to touch their skin again."
> 
> "These roaming ancestors will typically be seen carrying a lantern such as yours. %PCName, it is essential that the lantern returns to the otherworld. Otherwise the spirit you met will be trapped in the waking world and be driven mad. I can perform the necessary rituals of sending, but the ancestor chose to appear to you for a reason. You should be the one to put it back to rest. Will you accept this burden?"
> 
> "The lantern is a physical manifestation of the ancestor spirit's link to the otherworld. The dream world of the dead. While they possess it, they can roam [[grazelands|Sunna Guradan]] -- or the [[Grazelands]] as the settled people call it -- freely. But if they lose it, they will be doomed to wander until they descend into madness and must be banished."
