### [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sword_of_the_Moon_Reiver)
The Sword of the Moon Reiver (also known as the **Broadsword of the Moon Reiver** or **Moon-Cursed Blade**) is a broadsword created from [Mehrunes Dagon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mehrunes_Dagon "Lore:Mehrunes Dagon")'s own substance. It is believed that no other weapon is capable of harming Mehrunes Dagon. During Dagon's invasion of the [Battlespire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Battlespire "Lore:Battlespire") during the [Imperial Simulacrum](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Simulacrum "Lore:Imperial Simulacrum"), the sword was in the possession of his [Dark Seducer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dark_Seducer "Lore:Dark Seducer") bodyguard and paramour. An [apprentice](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Apprentice "Lore:Apprentice") took the sword from her and used it to banish the Prince from [his own realm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dagon%27s_Hunting_Lodge "Lore:Dagon's Hunting Lodge"), resulting in the destruction of the Battlespire.
