### Modded
The Urshilaku bury their dead in the earth and mummify using ash salts - and are the only tribe to actually live in the Ashlands region. They maintain the foundational beliefs of the Ashlanders through their keeping of the Nerevarine prophecies and offer guidance to Incarnates. These things enforce their association with the earth. They are the cornerstone of the Ashlanders and relatively stable and calm as individuals.

> We place our dead in the burial cavern. Most are devoured by beasts and returned to the earth. The most honored are preserved so that they may watch under us.
