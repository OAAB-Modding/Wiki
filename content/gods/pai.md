Pai is a well known patron demigod of unfinished tasks. Artisans and enchanters crowd his altars with half-finished trinkets and goods. The four-fold magical effects on [Pai's eponymous fiver rings](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Generic_Magic_Clothing#Ring_of_the_Five_Fingers_of_Pai) signify the time-told failure of creators to finish what they started.
