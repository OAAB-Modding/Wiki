To my esteemed student, [[aryon|Aryon]],

It is my custom to give a meaningful gift to each of my students as a celebration of their commencement. One which will not only aid in their studies, but in their endeavors beyond the academic as well. As you know, one of my favorite subjects of research and collection over the years has been related to the Imperial Battlespire and its unfortunate history. I know that in addition to sharing my fascination with the Dwemer, you and I also share a common interest in at least a few of the Imperial administrations.

I leave you a gift which I am sure you will quickly realize the importance of: the [[sword-of-the-moon-reiver|Sword of the Moon Reiver]]. This daedric blade was forged from the magical substance of the Lord of Destruction himself and recovered from the ruins of The Battlespire several years after its demise. You know that this is one of my prized possessions, but do not attempt to return it to me. I pass it on to you for I have no need of its affinity for destruction. But I believe a time is coming when possessing such an artifact will be more useful than simply as a conduit for studying the daedra. And if anyone is capable of discerning the practical applications when that time comes, I know it is you.

Respectfully, [[divayth-fyr|Divayth Fyr]]
