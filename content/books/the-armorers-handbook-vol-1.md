#### Volume I: Light Armor  
  
by Charles Alton Wayn  

This volume of the Armorer's Handbook covers the various types of light armor found in Morrowind. This handy reference will familiarize you with the construction of armor unique to this province, as well as some old familiar techniques. Of course, the best way to learn how to create these special types of armor is to travel and seek the guidance of masters. This guide will provide you with the basic knowledge you'll need not to look like a fool when you attempt to repair unfamiliar armors, but really the best way of learning is by doing.  

#### Nordic Fur
Nords are best known for creating light leather armor out of the hides of animals native to Skyrim and Solstheim, such as the bear and wolf. This armor provides comfort and warmth, and is light and flexible. However, it does not offer great protection in battle. It can be pierced easily by bladed weapons, and offers little protection from blunt trauma. This armor is best employed by hunters, as it offers the best protection from animal attacks and wayward arrows. Nordic bear armor is a heavier type of fur armor, which often dons the bear's full head as a helm. It is classified as a medium type armor.  
  
Fur armor is constructed using tanned hides and heavy stitching. The leather is carefully treated so it does not lose its fur. Thick hides are generally preferred. Tannins such as dung or urine are not used in this process. Instead, the process of brain tanning is employed. Oddly enough, each animal has just enough brains to tan its own hide, so tanning is often done in the field soon after skinning. Nords traditionally believe brain tanning infuses the hide with the spirit of the animal.  
  
After the hide is stretched across wooden stakes, it is fleshed using stone or bone tools. All meat and fat must be removed, leaving nothing but clean skin on the flesh side. After this is done, the brains are boiled in water and applied to the entire skin side of the hide. The hide is then left out in the sun for eight hours before submerging in water overnight.  
  
The next morning, the hide is re-staked and allowed to drain before working the hide over with a graining tool: a smooth stick with a round blunted point that fits comfortably in the hand. The hide must be worked until it is completely dry or else it will stiffen. Once the hide is dry, it is carefully worked by rubbing, skin-side down, over a smooth tree branch. The heat and friction will break up the grain further and complete the drying process. These hides can then be form molded by smoke curing, as opposed to boiling, which will prevent it from stiffening again on contact with water. When treating the hides you want them to retain their softness and elasticity.  
  
For heavier leather armor, such as the Nordic leather shield, this is treated with tannins, and boiling and waxing the leather. The leather will become incredibly stiff; it will not be possible to stitch together after this point. Instead, holes must be punched before the final treatment in the tanning process, and the leather is stitched over the shield frame using leather bindings before the final curing.  
  
The warmth this armor provides, as well as its low cost, make it an excellent choice for hunting expeditions in colder regions. It is hardly suitable for most other purposes however. As such, it is hardly a popular choice in Morrowind.  
  
#### Netch Leather
This armor is unique to the Dunmer people. It is made with netch hide, which is native to Vvardenfell. Typically found in the Ascadian Isles, the netch is a large floating creature, held aloft by internal gasses in its body. The hide of the bull netch is sturdy and supple, and makes leather armor of superior quality. The netch is also an incredibly large creature, providing ample skin to work with in a single kill. Netch leather is also thinner and more durable than other leather types.  
  
Netch armor comes in two varieties: in full sets of soft leather armor, and boiled helms and cuirasses. Because the netch has a smooth skin, de-furring the hide is not necessary. After the skin is fleshed with stone or bone tools, it is tanned. First the hide is bated using dung, which is rubbed into the skin. This relaxes the leather and prepares it for tanning. The dung is then washed from the hide and soaked by hanging the hide in a pit filled with water and crushed bark, which is the source of the tannins. The hide is soaked like this for two days before it is spread out to dry.  
  
This tanning process leaves the leather soft and supple. It can be easily stitched and formed before steam curing or boiling. Steam curing allows the leather to retain its softness even after it is formed, and it must be worked with a graining tool during this process. Boiling will create a much harder and sturdier armor, but it loses its flexibility. For this reason, only helms and cuirasses are treated in this manner.  
  
This armor is comfortable and affordable, and utilizes native materials. As such, it is the armor of choice amongst the Ashlanders and other peoples of Morrowind. It does not offer much in the way of protection in battle, but for daily protection it is quite suitable.  

#### Imperial Studded Leather  
This armor is imported from the mainland. As such, it is not commonly used in Vvardenfell, save for members of the Imperial Legion. The leather is tanned and cured in much the same way as other leather armors, after which studs are imbedded in the leather. The imbedded metal studs offer greater protection from bladed weapons, but little protection from blunt weapons. This armor is typically used during training rather than in battle.  
  
#### Chitin
Chitin is a type of light plate armor native to Vvardenfell, and is commonly favored by nomads and Ashlanders. It is constructed by laminating several layers of insect shell, glued with organic resins. The materials are gathered from the various species of kwama native to Vvardenfell, and other insects such as the shalk are used to provide the resins. Creating chitin armor is a time consuming process, but since it only requires local materials, it is cheap, easily produced, and commonly found in this province.  
  
The armor plates are boiled, then carefully cut. The boiling process softens the plates so they can be worked. The layers are pressed together with wooden blocks after the resin is applied. The layered plates are then stretched, as much as they can be, and tied over a dummy form. The formed plates are steam treated in place to complete the lamination process, then lacquered.  
  
Chitin is also used to create weapons, which are light and flexible. The edges are typically serrated because the blades cannot hold the superior edges of metal or glass. However, they are native and affordable, so they are quite commonly found.  
  
This armor is light and comfortable. Though it lacks the suppleness of leather armors, it is jointed and formed in a way that provides maximum flexibility. It is more resistant to blunt trauma, but can be easily penetrated by heavy bladed weapons. The closed chitin helms provide excellent protection from ash storms, and are therefore worn by many Dunmer living in Vvardenfell.  

#### Glass
Glass armor is the paramount of light armor. Its delicate and ornate elven design is unusual, but it happens to be one of the superior armors of the world. It is also the most enchantable of light armors. Glass armor is difficult to make, and expensive. The material costs alone mean only finest Dunmer craftsmen dare touch it. Nevertheless, it is important for any armorer to familiarize himself with the basics of its construction.  
  
The base plates of glass armor are constructed much in the same way as any plate armor. The joints are incredibly tight and precise, allowing for greater ease of movement. The plates are forged out of rare metals and embedded with large glass studs. The metal alone is soft and not suitable for armor; the glass studs provide its true strength. The metal's softness allows it to be easily carved with graving tools and set with glass stones.  
  
The settings are typically done by cold forming. The designs are embossed by chasing, which is working with a hammer and chisel along the top side of the metal plate. A graver is used to cut the bezel. This seat is cut deep, and perfectly shaped to the stone. Once the stone is fit, a setting punch and hammer is used to carefully form a wall of metal around the stone. The metal is then burnished, which work-hardens the soft metal so it holds the stone firm. Often, a hot resin is lightly applied to the interior of the bezels before setting, which helps keep the stones firmly glued in place.  
  
Heat is not recommended when repairing these armors, nor is it required. The metal is soft enough to work with cold. A small hammer and a light touch is needed. Broken glass stones can be replaced and set with hot resin. Some cutting with graving tools might be required to accommodate the new stone's shape, and the metal can be pushed back up around it to tighten the fit.  
  
Glass armor is lightweight, highly flexible, and stronger than steel. It is resistant to bladed weapons, and distributes shock well, making it highly resistant to blunt force. It is in fact stronger than most medium armors. The volcanic glass also produces blades of unparalleled sharpness. These weapons are light, flexible, and sturdy, making them much sought after. This armor is favored by the Buoyant Armigers of Vvardenfell, many of whom are nobles of Great House Indoril. Glass creates a light battle armor of the highest quality.  
  
The next volume of The Armorer's Handbook will cover medium armor, and how to create and repair chain, ring, and scale mail, as well as some types of light plate and heavier laminates.
