Although it's original purpose is a mystery to me, I have found that the dwemer ideographer can be used to create summoning scrolls through a relatively cost effective process.

Required materials:
- 1 Blank Scroll (of standard quality or better)
- 1 Vial of Ink (must be of a magical scribing grade material)
- 1 Soul Gem (common or better in quality)

The soul gem does not need to be filled, but it needs to be large enough to hold the relative soul size of the target you wish to summon. This is the "magic" of the device. The dwemer somehow figured out a way to transform the machine's energy into magic. I made a few changes to the device in order to feed that magic into the soul gem and enchant the scrolls. I still don't understand what the machine's intended use was, but I was able to repurpose it to function as a magical scroll creator.

P.S.
Please use the tray near the ideographer to pour inkwells into smaller containers to avoid making a mess all over my lab, %PCName. Please feel free to use any of the supplies in there for your own research. If you need to purchase more blank scrolls, talk to [[alenus-vendu|Alenus Vendu]] in the Services Tower.
