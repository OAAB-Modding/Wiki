This is how I would write the story of Red Wisdom, to the best of my memory, in a more Imperial style.

***

When the three hands that cursed their bearers  
Lose their grip, and skies are cleared of terrors  
Gather food, gather weapons  
For the fate that star-fall threatens  
Child who was buried under the Harrow  
Only Red Wisdom can guide you  
Child who sprouted in the Grotto  
Walk with the blessed beside you  
Child who the Hound chased into fires  
Only Red Wisdom can hide you  
Child who the Guar led to the flyers  
Find the wisdom that unified you
