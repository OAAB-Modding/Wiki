### First Addition
Recent archeological successes have allowed a coherer and set of cylinders to come into my possession. These strange devices appear to have been used to augment a [[the-calling|telepathic link]] between the ancient [[races/dwemer/index|Dwemer]].

Master [[Aryon]]
### Second Addition
Thanks to the efforts of other dwemer scholars, I have managed to acquire a pristine centurion spider specimen. Its aggressive behavior has been disabled at the cost of causing it to leak oil. Mind the puddle and please don't touch the animunculi!

Master [[Aryon]]
### Third Addition
Collecting dwemer artifacts under Imperial rule always comes with hazards. I had to pay off a particularly persistent official to secure the latest additions to my museum. In addition to a rather mundane set of kitchenware, I've also added a [[puzzle-boxes|puzzle box]]. Contrary to popular belief, in general these contraptions were little more than toys for Dwemer children. I managed to solve it and found a handful of coins inside which are on display next to the box.

### Fourth Addition
Dwemer Wyrm Gear

This mysterious artifact is so named for its mystifying and seemingly perpetual coiling motion; reminiscent of how some scholars imagine theorize the flow of time in the mortal plane may appear were mortals able to visualize it. What this device may have been used for is a mystery. An attempt to harness the power of repeating patterns in time? One of many cogs in a complex machine? We may never know. But it seems to harness the power of one of the [[earthbones]] we associate with lodestones to hover in mid air. A child could tug it behind them with a rope.
