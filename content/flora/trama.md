> "A calming tea with modest magical properties is brewed from the thick, bitter-tasting root of the trama shrub. The Trama shrub grows in the bitter, ashy soils of the Ashlands, Molag Amur, and Red Mountain."
> -- Anarenen (dialogue)
### Modded

> "Now, the next thing Mistress [[dratha|Dratha]] specifically requested were some trama shrubs. They are naturally an invasive species so I will simply take a few of the root thorns and graft them to a hackle-lo plant to contain their growth. I believe the thorns themselves (even when grafted) can grow into a full root to produce more of the thorns which can be used as cuttings in alchemical brews. Three thorns should be enough."
> -- Liela (dialogue) <sup>[1]</sup>
